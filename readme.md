This is the Members Only assignment from The Odin Project.  The purpose of this project is to create an interactive message board with expressJS, bcrypt, mongoDB, and express validator.  Users can create an account and the password is hashed.  The user can login and the hashed password will be validated.  Users can post messages, but cannot see who posted them or when unless they are a member.  To become a member you must enter the secret pass code.  Members can see who posted a message.  Admins can also delete messages.

The project needs to be styled and pages need to properly redirect for users who are not logged if they enter a URL manually.
